# MuseScore Rich presence
Discord Rich Presence for MuseScore

## Usage Instrctions
\* Currently only works for Windows and MuseScore 2.  
\** Adding support for Mac should be really easy, but I don't own a Mac to test it on.

1. Install the CurrentScoreInfo-MS2.qml Plugin Into MuseScore
2. When inside MuseScore, enable the plugin. Then click on the button once under Plugins -> CurrentScoreInfo to run it.
3. Clone this repository and install node modules (`npm i`)
4. Run rpc.js (`node src/rpc.js`)

Tada! I'm looking forward to refining this and making it work better in the future.

## Examples
\* This Rich Presence includes active states, meaning your state will constantly change to show more information (similar to my other Rich Presence for American Trucking Simulator (ATS)). Below shows an example for each one of those.
