# MuseScore Rich presence
Discord Rich Presence for MuseScore

## Usage Instrctions
\* Currently only works for Windows and MuseScore 2.  
\** Adding support for Mac should be really easy, but I don't own a Mac to test it on.

1. Install the CurrentScoreInfo-MS2.qml Plugin Into MuseScore
2. When inside MuseScore, enable the plugin. Then click on the button once under Plugins -> CurrentScoreInfo to run it.
3. Clone this repository and install node modules (`npm i`)
4. Run rpc.js (`node src/rpc.js`)

Tada! I'm looking forward to refining this and making it work better in the future.
